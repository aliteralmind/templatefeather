**Template Featherweight**: A simplistic Java template-rendering engine, providing for *plain gaps only*, such as "Hello, %name%!"--it has no advanced features such as if-logic, looping, or expressions--Templates may be output in full, after all gaps have been filled, or they may be *auto-rendered*, such that they are gradually output as each gap is filled.
